Several psychological measures that are potentially useful to an online survey system have been identified and included in the available Github repository. The included measures were selected, in part, because invited students could take them for personal enrichment. Learning about oneâ€™s own psychological profile not only introduces students to the research process but can also be useful to develop in-class discussions in a psychology course. Included are the following scales: The Action Control Scale (Kuhl & Beckmann, 1994), The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (Patton et al., 1995), The Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (Leary, 1983), The Internal-External Locus of Control Scale (Rotter, 1966), The Life Orientation Test, Revised (Scheier & Carver, 1985a), The Obsessive Compulsive Inventory, Revised (Foa et al., 2002), The Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) (Watson et al., 1988), the Risk Taking Index (RTI) (Nicholson et al., 2005), The Self-Consciousness Scale (Scheier & Carver, 1985b), Revised, the Life Satisfaction Scale (Diener et al., 1985), The Meaning in Life Scale (Steger et al., 2006), The COPE Inventory (Carver et al., 1989), The Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen et al., 1983), and the Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) Scale (Gosling et al., 2003).
